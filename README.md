# Portal-Noticias

This project is a result of a course to learn more about NodeJS's modules. These modules are the framework 'express' to easily build and run a web server, the autoload tool 'consign' to automatically loads files in a MVC structure, the module 'body-parser' to easily convert forms in json and the module 'express-validator' to validate data request made by the clients into our web server. The project itself it's a basically news portal where you can register news and list then. The project was structured in MVC to easily scale its development and work correctly with the autoload 'consign'.
